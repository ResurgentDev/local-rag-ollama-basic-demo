# Download necessary NLTK resources
def ensure_punkt():
    """
    Ensures the 'punkt' tokenizer resource from NLTK is available for use.

    The 'punkt' tokenizer is part of NLTK's corpus resources and is required
    for tokenizing text into sentences. It is not included by default with the
    base NLTK package and must be downloaded separately.

    This function dynamically checks if the 'punkt' tokenizer is already
    downloaded on the user's machine. If not, it automatically downloads the
    resource. Once downloaded, it is stored locally and does not require
    re-downloading for future use, allowing the tool to function offline.

    Key Features:
    - Dynamically verifies the availability of the 'punkt' resource using
      `nltk.data.find('tokenizers/punkt')`.
    - Provides informative messaging to users about the status of the resource
      (e.g., whether it is already available or being downloaded).
    - Only downloads the resource when necessary, minimizing redundant operations.

    Advantages:
    - Supports scenarios where the tool is run in environments with limited or
      pre-configured resources, avoiding unnecessary downloads.
    - Improves user experience by ensuring the necessary resource is available
      without requiring manual intervention.

    Usage Notes:
    - Users must have an active internet connection for the initial download of
      the 'punkt' tokenizer. Once downloaded, the tool can operate offline.
    - The downloaded resource is typically stored in the default NLTK data
      directory (e.g., `~/.nltk_data` or `%APPDATA%/nltk_data`).
    - If distributing the tool, developers may pre-download the 'punkt' resource
      and package it with the tool to eliminate the need for dynamic downloads.

    Example:
    >>> ensure_punkt()
    [INFO] 'punkt' tokenizer is already downloaded and available for use.

    Implementation:
    This function is designed to be reusable and modular, allowing it to be
    integrated seamlessly into any NLTK-based application.
